|| Dependencies (included & statically linked) ||

    libpthread

|| What it does ||

When kernel is done, it automatically starts /init - This is that thing

1. Mounts /sys /proc /dev - Multithreaded
2. Loads kernel modules (Currently hardcoded) - Multithreaded
3. Loads /etc/fstab
4. Prepares filesystem for /dev/vda or /dev/sda
5. Mounts /dev/vda or /dev/sda if present and EXT4
6. Execve's switch_root into /dev/vda and starts the vda or sda /init as PID 1


|| Source Layout ||

    init.c - Main file                                     (The entry point (pain-t) )
    helpers/sysmnt.c - Loads /proc /sys /dev /etc/fstab    (So the kernel has a safe space to yap)
    helpers/mods.c - Loads kernel modules                  (So your wifi and disks work)
    helpers/fsld.c - Helpers for loading the main drive (/dev/vda) (Cause like, you kinda need a disk)

    pkg.sh - For creating tar.gz & zip                     (Cause im not remembering the curse of .zip)
    autobuild.sh - Bash script for autorunning meson       (Cause im not type 3 words every 5 minutes)
    git.sh - Git Automation - Called by above 2            (Cause if i accidentlly rm -rf . everythings safe)

    include/ - Headers for dependencies                    (So the compiler can be not stupid)
    lib/ - Static libraries for dependencies               (Cause static = more pain now less pain later)
    arm-linux.cross - Cross-compiler target for Meson      (Cause mac, same for linux-aarch.cmake)
    meson.build - Meson build script                       (Cause its not 1995)
    dist/ - If you used the script this is where meson installs (Cause meson doesnt know where you are in your filesystem) 
    .gitignore - Git Ignore                                (So you dont have to download 3 cache folders)
    CMakeLists.txt                                         (A whole lotta sadness so CLion doesnt hate me)
    Makefile                                               (A Wrapper around the other 2 build systems)

    README - This file                            (If you didnt know the file your reading is the one displayed by github)
    LICENSE - License blob                                 (So nobody misses the license)
    LegalStuff - self-explanatory                          (So i dont get sued or have to sue someone :D)
    GPLv2 - GPL version 2 text                             (So your lawyer doesnt have to click more links)
