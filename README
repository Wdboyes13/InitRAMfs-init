|| Dependencies (included & statically linked) ||

|| What it does ||

When kernel is done, it automatically starts /init - This is that thing

1. Mounts /sys /proc /dev
2. Loads /etc/fstab
3. Loads kernel modules (Currently hardcoded)
4. Prepares filesystem for /dev/vda
5. Mounts /dev/vda if present and EXT4
6. Execve's switch_root into /dev/vda and starts SystemD as PID 1


|| Source Layout ||

    init.c - Main file                                          (The entry point (pain-t) )
    helpers/sysmnt.c - Loads /proc /sys /dev /etc/fstab         (So the kernel has a safe space to yap)
    helpers/mods.c - Loads kernel modules                       (So your wifi and disks work)
    helpers/fsld.c - Helpers for loading the main drive (/dev/vda) (Cause like, you kinda need a disk)

    pkg.sh - For creating tar.gz & zip                          (Cause im not remembering the curse of .zip)
    autobuild.sh - Bash script for autorunning meson            (Cause im not type 3 words every 5 minutes)

    include/ - Headers for dependencies                         (So the compiler can be not stupid)
    lib/ - Static libraries for dependencies                    (Cause static = more pain now less pain later)
    arm-linux.cross - Cross-compiler target for Meson           (Cause mac)
    meson.build - Meson build script                            (Cause its not 1995)
    dist/ - If you used the script this is where meson installs (Cause meson doesnt know where you are in your filesystem)
